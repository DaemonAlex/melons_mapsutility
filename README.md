If you don't see the creators of maps you use it's because the presets are based on maps that I have on my server and from creators who have made themselves available for the creation of presets and on which I can therefore make presets, if you are a creator and you want presets for your maps contact me on Discord, if instead you are a server owner and you want a certain preset for a creator's maps ask the creator to contact me on discord to organize us (Please don't ask me as I'm poor and I can't do anything about it)
